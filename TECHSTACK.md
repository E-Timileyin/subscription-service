For a **subscription service SaaS project** thatâ€™s realistic for tech companies and fits your skill level (junior â†’ mid), hereâ€™s a solid **tech stack recommendation** using MongoDB:

---

## **1. Backend**

* **Node.js + Express** â€“ handles API routes, middleware, and business logic.
* **Mongoose (MongoDB ORM)** â€“ schema modeling, validations, and relations.
* **Authentication:**

  * **JWT + Refresh Tokens** â€“ secure login/session management.
  * Optional: OAuth2 (Google/GitHub login).

---

## **2. Database**

* **MongoDB** â€“ stores users, subscriptions, plans, payments.
* Optional: **Redis** â€“ caching active subscriptions or rate-limiting requests.

---

## **3. Payments / Billing**

* **Stripe** â€“ handles recurring payments, webhooks, and invoices.
* Optional: PayPal if you want multi-gateway support.

---

## **4. Notifications / Emails**

* **NodeMailer** or **SendGrid** â€“ for subscription reminders, payment receipts, trial expiration.

---

## **5. Deployment / DevOps**

* **Docker** â€“ containerize your backend.
* **Hosting:**

  * **Railway** / **Render** / **Heroku** â€“ quick and beginner-friendly.
  * Optional: **AWS/GCP** for cloud deployment experience.
* **Environment Variables:** `.env` for API keys, DB URI, JWT secrets.

---

## **6. Testing & Documentation**

* **Testing:** Jest + Supertest for unit/integration tests.
* **Documentation:** Swagger or Postman collection.

---

## **7. Optional Frontend (if you want full-stack)**

* **React + Tailwind CSS** â€“ simple dashboard for users to manage subscriptions.
* Or just **Postman/Swagger** for API demo if you focus purely on backend.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Why this stack works for companies:**

* Itâ€™s modern and widely used in SaaS startups.
* MongoDB is scalable and pairs well with Node.js.
* Stripe integration is production-ready and mirrors real-world business logic.
* Focuses on **backend fundamentals**: auth, payments, subscriptions, role-based access.
